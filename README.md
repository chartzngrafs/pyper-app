## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Configuration Issues
```bash
# Check if config exists
ls -la config/config.json

# Validate JSON syntax
python -m json.tool config/config.json

# Check log file for errors
tail -f pyper.log
```

### Connection Issues
- Verify Navidrome server is running and accessible
- Test by accessing Navidrome web interface first  
- Check URL format includes `http://` or `https://`
- Verify username and password are correct
- Check `pyper.log` for detailed connection error messages

### SSH/Database Issues
- Ensure SSH key authentication is set up correctly
- Test SSH connection manually: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@server`
